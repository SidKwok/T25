# T25
> Shaun T is my God!

# Introduction

I couldn't find a suitable app for me to record my *T25* process with weight, height and so on. Since VueJs 2.0 comes out, I decided to build the app to help me lose some weight.(Didn't mean I'm already fatðŸ˜€)

## Noted

No need to care too much about the server, I deployed it to **LeanCloud** so that I can record it at home or anywhere else. So if you want to check out the code, step in the folder `fe`.

## Tech stack:

 - **VueJs 2.0** for UI
 - **vue-router** for Router
 - **vue-resource** for data fetching
 - **Vuex** for state management
 - **vue-cli** for building the project's structure

## Get start

Go to The File Folder `fe` to do the command line!

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Checkout `localhost: 8080` in the browser!

If it doesn't work, try `sudo`ã€‚

To run the unit tests.
```bash
npm run unit
```
